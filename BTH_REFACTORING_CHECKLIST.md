---

## Next Steps (Action Required)

### 1. Set Up New Supabase Project (Required)
Since you're starting fresh with BTH+, you need a new database:

```bash
# Step 1: Go to https://supabase.com and create new project

# Step 2: In Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# Paste entire contents of SUPABASE_SCHEMA.sql and run it

# Step 3: Get your API keys from Settings → API
# Copy to .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

**Detailed guide:** See `THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Supabase section

### 2. Create/Update Brevo Account (For Emails)
Update your email sending service:

```bash
# Step 1: Go to https://brevo.com and sign up

# Step 2: Verify a sender email (e.g., noreply@bth.
.store)

# Step 3: Get API key from Settings → SMTP & API

# Step 4: Add to .env.local:
BREVO_API_KEY=xsmtpsib-your-api-key
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@bth.
.store
```

**Note:** Email templates are already updated from AMOB
to BTH+ branding.

**Detailed guide:** See `THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Brevo section

### 3. Create/Update Paystack Account (For Payments)
Set up payment processing:

```bash
# Step 1: Go to https://paystack.com and sign up with business email

# Step 2: Complete KYC verification (takes 1-2 business days)

# Step 3: Get API keys from Settings → API Keys & Webhooks

# Step 4: Add to .env.local:
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_KEY=pk_live_your-public-key
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your-secret-key

# Step 5: Configure webhook in Paystack:
# https://yourdomain.com/api/paystack-webhook
```

**Note:** Paystack payment flow code is unchanged - only credentials need updating.

**Detailed guide:** See `THIRD_PARTY_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Paystack section

### 4. Update Environment Variables
Create/update `.env.local` in your project root:

```bash
# Database
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key-here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here

# Email
BREVO_API_KEY=xsmtpsib-your-api-key
BREVO_SENDER_EMAIL=noreply@bth.
.store

# Payments
NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYSTACK_KEY=pk_live_your-public-key
PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your-secret-key
```

### 5. Add Products to Your New Database
Once Supabase is set up:

```bash
# Option 1: Use Supabase Dashboard
# Go to products table and click "Insert Row"
# Add your products manually

# Option 2: Import CSV
# Prepare CSV with: id, name, description, category, price, stock, images, variants
# Use Supabase import feature

# Note: Include image URLs (hosted on CDN or Supabase Storage)
```

### 6. Update Site Content
In Supabase Dashboard, update the `site_content` table:

| Key | Value | Notes |
|-----|-------|-------|
| `landing_background` | Your hero image URL | Large background image for landing page |
| `about_us` | Your about text | Displayed on /about page |
| `site_name` | "BTH+ Essentials" | Or your preferred name |
| `site_tagline` | "Elegant. Timeless. Essential." | Your tagline |

### 7. Test Everything Locally
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000
# Test:
# - [ ] Products load correctly
# - [ ] Navigation looks good (black/white aesthetic)
# - [ ] Add to cart works
# - [ ] Checkout process works
# - [ ] Payment page appears
# - [ ] Order confirmation email sends (check Brevo logs)
```

### 8. Deploy to Production
When ready to launch:

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your hosting provider
# Set production environment variables in hosting platform
# Use pk_live_ and sk_live_ for Paystack
# Use production Supabase URL/keys
```

## Design Philosophy: Black & White Aesthetic

Your BTH+ store now embodies:

- **Minimalism**: Clean, uncluttered design
- **Elegance**: White space and sharp typography
- **Professional**: High contrast for accessibility
- **Timeless**: Not trendy, lasting visual appeal
- **Versatile**: Works well with any product category

The black and white palette:
- ✅ Works on all devices (no color-related contrast issues)
- ✅ Professional appearance for B2B or premium brands
- ✅ Excellent readability
- ✅ Fast loading (no color gradients)
- ✅ Easy to customize accent colors later
